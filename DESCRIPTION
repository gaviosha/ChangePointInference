Description: R implementation of the procedure introduced in the paper 
    "Fast and Optimal Inference for Change Points in Piecewise Polynomials via Differencing".
    Given a vector of observations from a one dimensional signal + noise model,
    where the signal is a piecewise polynomial function of known degree, 
    the procedure returns disjoint intervals which must each contain a change point location
    uniformly at some level specified by the parameter `alpha`.
